# Entity Component System - Javascript Tutorial
This is a basic example of Entity Component System (ECS) in Javascript. The corresponding tutorial of what ECS is can be found at [BLOG URL].

A running demo can be seen at : [ URL ]

## Code Structure
This is a no frills approach to demonstrate ECS. To demonstrate concepts, it does not use CommonJS / RequireJS or any other third party dependencies. NOTE: I strongly recommend using [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to manage script loading.
