# Entity Component System - Javascript Demo
![Rectangle Eater](https://s3.amazonaws.com/vasir-assets/rectangle-eater/rectangleeater.gif)

This is a basic example of Entity Component System (ECS) in Javascript. The corresponding tutorial of what ECS is can be found at [BLOG URL]. Because this is used to demonstrate ECS specific concepts, many best practices (such as using modules, e.g., Browserify) are not observed in favor of simplifying concepts.

A running demo can be seen at : [ URL ]

## Code Structure
This is a no frills approach to demonstrate ECS. To demonstrate concepts, it does not use CommonJS / RequireJS or any other third party dependencies. Warning: this code was thrown together in a couple hours and is intended to be used for demonstration purposes only.
